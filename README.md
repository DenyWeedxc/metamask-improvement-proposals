# MetaMask Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Repository
Welcome to the MetaMask Improvement Proposals (MIPs) repository. This repository serves as a public space to discuss, evaluate, and implement improvements to the MetaMask Wallet API. Our goal is to create a more robust and effective API by actively involving developers and prioritizing their feedback.

# Core Aims and Approach
1. Establish a transparent process for MetaMask Improvement Proposals.
2. Prioritize feedback from developers actively integrating with MetaMask.
3. Ensure a committed set of developers are ready to adopt changes before investing time in implementation.


# Proposal lifecycle or "workflow"
To maintain consistency and ensure a smooth evaluation process, the all proposals will be assigned one of the following stages throughout its lifecycle:

1. Draft: Initial proposal submission.
2. Review: Community feedback and discussion.
3. Last Call: Final revisions and acceptance criteria.
4. Accepted: Proposal approved by MetaMask team.
5. Implemented: Changes have been integrated into MetaMask.
6. Rejected: Proposal deemed not suitable for implementation.
